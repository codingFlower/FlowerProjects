The program will store various information about events, the events will be listed using "TreeView".
The program will also have functions to register a new user to an event and possibly even add new events (we haven't decided yet).
The program supports real time flow simulation and can filter out events to upcoming and past events using the given todays date.
The program also filters out the events by the organisers.
The program will be able to show the rating of past events and will have a voting system on past events.
The program reads it's initial data from the file "Event.txt" and doesn't use an absolute path.

With these articles we learned how to use "TreeViews" and we implemented them in our program.
